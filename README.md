# Project Overview
# Title: Text Classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM)
# Description:
This project focuses on building a text classification model using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The primary goal is to explore the effectiveness of SVM in categorizing text data and optimizing its performance through the analysis of various hyperparameters and features.

 Project Structure:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

 Understand and preprocess the text data.
Utilize TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for feature representation.
Model Building:

Implement SVM with different kernels (linear, rbf, poly).
Explore the impact of hyperparameters (C, kernel type) on model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Conduct a thorough analysis of hyperparameters to optimize SVM performance.
Investigate the effects of different values of C and kernel types.
Feature Representation:

Investigate the influence of max_features in TF-IDF on model efficiency.
Analyze the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.
Visualization and Reporting:

Visualize results using graphs and tables.
Provide insights into the performance of SVM with various configurations.
Files Included:
Report file.pdf: Project description document.
Source.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the project.
imdb_reviews.csv: Dataset for text classification.
README.md: Project overview document.
Instructions for Running the Code:
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (scikit-learn, matplotlib).
Open the Jupyter Notebook Source.ipynb.
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to execute the code.
Conclusion:
The project aims to provide insights into the performance of SVM in text classification tasks and guide users in optimizing hyperparameters for efficient and accurate model training.
